The website is not responsive, except the grid to some degree. It should be viewed in the chrome browser.

I'm particular proud of: Finishing the Project and implementing Spring Security^^


## Project grading 

My remarks:
+ You could have implemented the image fetching on server side.
The testing would have been easier so, wouldn't?
+ The application flow could be improved.

Kindly refer to [GradedExercise.xlsx](GradedExercise.xlsx) for grading details.

A neat application which works like a charm. With a bit more effort/time investment could become
a really cool one. Congrats!

Grade: **5.5**
