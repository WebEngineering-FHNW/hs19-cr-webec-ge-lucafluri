    <h1>Image Searcher</h1>
    <h4>webeC Semester Project by Luca Fluri (Fall 2019)</h4>

    <p>
        Welcome to my Project the "Image Searcher".<br/>
        The goal of this project was to use multiple API's of image websites, <br/>
        collect returned images and display them in a grid.
        I added a Role Based Security, so that a user can be created and logged in <br/>
        to save his or her favorite images.
    </p>
    <p>
        The User Flow is as follows:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            To start you can either create a new user or use the default user (username: user, password: user).
        </li>
        <li>
            You can use the website without a login, but favoriting an images, requires to be logged in.
        </li>
        <li>
            You can enter a searchterm and select from 3 sources (GIPHY, Unsplash, Pixabay).
        </li>
        <li>
            The images are then being fetched and awaited. After all selected sources are successfully fetched <br/>
            they are displayed in a masonry grid via javascript.
        </li>
        <li>
            The user can then favorite his most liked images for later if he wishes to do so.
        </li>
        <li>
            The favorites can be accessed via the favorite button.
        </li>
    </ul>
